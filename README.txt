The python file wordCount.py takes in its arguement an <input file> to be read
from and an <output> file to write to. The program then breaks down the input
file into individual words, keeping count of the number of times an given word
repeats and writes it to another text file in either descending or ascending
order.
To run the program, type

$python3 wordCount.py <inputFile> <outputFile>

then press return.

Given no errors, such as incorrect input file, a file will now be in your
program's directory by the name of which you declared the output file to be,
listing the words and count.
